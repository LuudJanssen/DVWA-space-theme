        <p>Security level is currently: <em><?= $this->data['securityLevel'] ?></em>.<p>

        <p>You can set the security level to low, medium, high or impossible. The security level changes the vulnerability level of DVWA:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Low - This security level is completely vulnerable and <em>has no security measures at all</em>. It's use is to be as an example of how web application vulnerabilities manifest through bad coding practices and to serve as a platform to teach or learn basic exploitation techniques.</li>
            <li> Medium - This setting is mainly to give an example to the user of <em>bad security practices</em>, where the developer has tried but failed to secure an application. It also acts as a challenge to users to refine their exploitation techniques.</li>
            <li> High - This option is an extension to the medium difficulty, with a mixture of <em>harder or alternative bad practices</em> to attempt to secure the code. The vulnerability may not allow the same extent of the exploitation, similar in various Capture The Flags (CTFs) competitions.</li>
            <li> Impossible - This level should be <em>secure against all vulnerabilities</em>. It is used to compare the vulnerable source code to the secure source code.<br />
                Priority to DVWA v1.9, this level was known as 'high'.</li>

    <p><?= $this->externalLink('https://github.com/PHPIDS/PHPIDS', 'PHPIDS') ?> v<?= $this->data['PHPIDSVersion'] ?> (PHP-Intrusion Detection System) is a security layer for PHP based web applications.</p>
    <p>PHPIDS works by filtering any user supplied input against a blacklist of potentially malicious code. It is used in DVWA to serve as a live example of how Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) can help improve security and in some cases how WAFs can be circumvented.</p>
